Hereâ€™s the rewritten `.md` file for your content:

## Ciphertext:
`hoZyGgMHU4dM+8zgZAPXhA==`
```
```
The above ciphertext contains characters like `+` and `=`, indicating that this is a base64-encoded string. Since it contains a secret key, it's likely encrypted using a symmetric cipher algorithm.

## Morse Code:
```
... ...-- -.-. .-. ...-- - -.- ...-- -.-- .--.-. .---- ..--- ...-- ....- ..... -....
```
When decoded using a Morse code translator (e.g., [morsecode-translator.com](https://www.morsecode-translator.com/)), we get the following secret key:

## Secret Key:
`S3CR3TK3Y@123456`

This is a 16-character secret key, meaning it's most likely a 128-bit encryption key for the ciphertext. We can use the following link to decrypt the ciphertext using AES encryption: [AES Encryption/Decryption Tool](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption).

Finally, after decryption, the result is:

## Password:
`algorithmissafe`

Using the above password, we can extract the secret code from the PDF file.

## Secret Code:
`CogML24@2024`
```
```
